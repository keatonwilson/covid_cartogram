# Covid-19 Cartogram  
A set of scripts that leverage the [growing New York Times dataset on Covid-19 
in the United States](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) to create 
cartograms (data visualizations that map polygon area to a data source, here the number of cases per week for each state) that are animated over time. 

Currently the [cartogram for states](./output/state_cartogram.gif) is working 
and will be updated weekly. County-level cartograms are a work in progress.  

Any comments, edits or ideas are welcome!
